    "### Linear Regression\n",
    "Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used to model and analyze the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal of linear regression is to find the linear relationship between the variables, which can be used to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "1. Dependent Variable (Y): The outcome or the variable we are trying to predict or explain.\n",
    "2. Independent Variable (X): The variable(s) used to predict or explain the dependent variable.\n",
    "3. Linear Relationship: The relationship between the dependent and independent variables can be expressed as a straight line.\n",
    "4. Regression Line: The best-fit line through the data points that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values.\n",
    "### Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "Simple linear regression involves a single independent variable. The model can be represented as:\n",
    "Y = β0 + β1 X + ε\n",
    "- Y is the dependent variable.\n",
    "- X is the independent variable.\n",
    "- β0 is the y-intercept.\n",
    "- β1 is the slope of the regression line.\n",
    "- ε is the error term.\n",
    "### Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "Multiple linear regression involves more than one independent variable. The model can be represented as:\n",
    "Y = β0 + β1 X1 + β2 X2 + ... + βn Xn + ε\n",
    "- Y is the dependent variable.\n",
    "- X1, X2, ..., Xn are the independent variables.\n",
    "- β0 is the y-intercept.\n",
    "- β1, β2, ..., βn are the coefficients of the independent variables.\n",
    "- ε is the error term.\n",
    "### Assumptions of Linear Regression\n",
    "1. Linearity: The relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear.\n",
    "2. Independence: The residuals (errors) are independent.\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: The residuals have constant variance at every level of the independent variable.\n",
    "4. Normality: The residuals of the model are normally distributed.\n",
    "### Steps in Performing Linear Regression\n",
    "1. Data Collection: Gather the data for the dependent and independent variables.\n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables if necessary.\n",
    "3. Model Fitting: Use statistical software or programming languages (like Python or R) to fit the linear regression model to the data.\n",
    "4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and residual analysis.\n",
    "5. Prediction: Use the model to make predictions on new data.\n",
    "Example in Python\n",
    "Here's an example of how to perform simple linear regression in Python using the scikit-learn library:\n",
